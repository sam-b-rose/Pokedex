Know your Pokemon with the help of the pokedex app. Utilizes the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve details on all Pokemon generations.

This app was build to help me learn the basics of iOS development and Swift. Core concepts I learned:

- how to make network requests to an API using [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- implement a scrollable grid layout with UICollectionView
- dynamically load image assets
- how to work with CocoaPods
- play and pause sound output
- details about several Pokemon ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
